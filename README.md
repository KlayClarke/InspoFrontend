# InspoFrontend

This repo contains the front end code (React, ChakraUI) for my very simple photo sharing web application. This app is influenced by Pexels.com and was created because I desired to try out FastAPI. I must say, I am impressed with their documentation, as well as the built-in /docs feature that essentially (1) documents the api code, and (2) allows users to test their api without using a third party app (Postman) or CURL.
